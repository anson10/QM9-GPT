# QM9-GPT: Molecular Inverse Design Lab

##  Project Overview

QM9-GPT is a deep learning platform that performs Inverse Molecular Design process of starting with a desired physical property and generating the chemical structure that satisfies it.

While traditional drug discovery relies on screening existing databases, this project uses a Conditional WaveNet to produce entirely new molecules optimized for specific HOMO-LUMO energy gaps.

## How It Works (The "Engine")

The system consists of three interconnected neural components that work in a feedback loop:

### 1. The Language Model (Generator)

* **Architecture**: A WaveNet-style model using  to capture long-range dependencies in SMILES strings.
* **Sampling**: Implements Temperature Scaling () to balance chemical validity () against structural novelty ().

### 2. The Property Predictor (Critic)

* **Task**: Acts as an independent "judge" to verify if the AI's invention actually meets the target energy gap.
* **Accuracy**: Achieves high correlation on the QM9 test set (refer to the Parity Plot below).

### 3. The Discovery Pipeline (Inference)

* **Validity Loop**: Automatically filters out syntactically incorrect SMILES using RDKit.
* **Novelty Check**: Cross-references every generated molecule against the 133,885 structures in the QM9 Dataset to ensure the AI has discovered a brand-new molecule rather than memorizing a known one.
